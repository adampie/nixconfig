- Prefer updating existing code over creating new code
- Always add trailing newlines to files
- Remove trailing whitespace
- Only add comments to complex code
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
- Use secure coding standards and guidelines
- Use dependency scanning tools
- Understand relevant compliance requirements (GDPR, SOC2, etc.)
- Use encryption for sensitive data processing
- Maintain audit trails for compliance reporting
- Implement data retention and deletion policies
